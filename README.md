# TEstimating Time Series Averages from Latent Space of Multi-tasking Neural Networks.

# Description:
<p align="justify">
In this page, we present some examples demonstrating means estimated by our proposed approaches. To estimate the means, we used the train split of the UCR archive. However, in the plots, the time series ploted using silver colour are extracted from the test split. Moreover, the time seires in blue indicates the averages estimated from the training split.
